Changes to pi made by Claude:

Here are the files that have been modified on the Raspberry Pi:

Boot Configuration Files:

/boot/firmware/config.txt - Modified with USB gadget settings:
/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt - Modified with kernel parameters:
Added modules-load=dwc2,libcomposite
Added udc.0=dwc2
Added udc.force_peripheral=1
Added usbcore.authorized_default=0
USB Gadget Configurations:

/sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/nanoptix-paycheck4/ - First attempt at gadget config
/sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/printer/ - Second attempt at gadget config
Installed Packages:

libusbgx2 - USB gadget configuration library
libusbgx-dev - Development files for USB gadget configuration
Both USB gadget configurations are still present in the system, which might be causing conflicts. The boot configuration files have been modified to enable USB peripheral mode and load the necessary kernel modules at boot time.
